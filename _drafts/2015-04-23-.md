What is automation?

<h3>Definitions from dictionary.com</h3>

Modern Language Association (MLA):
"automation." Dictionary.com Unabridged. Random House, Inc. 21 May. 2015. <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/automation">Dictionary.com http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/automation</a>

noun
1. the technique, method, or system of operating or controlling a process by highly automatic means, as by electronic devices, reducing human intervention to a minimum.

<strong>Origin of the word</strong>
1945-50; autom(atic oper)ation

I particularly liked the British Dictionary Definition
1. the use of methods for controlling industrial processes automatically, esp by electronically controlled systems, often reducing manpower
2. the extent to which a process is so controlled

Item #2, "the extent to which a process is so controlled". I interpret this to mean that there are indeed different levels of automation and I have always thought that to be the case.

Automation is an iterative process that builds upon itself. Maybe times it starts as an idea.
