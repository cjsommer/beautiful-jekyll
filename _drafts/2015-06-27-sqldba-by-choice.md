I started my IT career in 1997 and most of the next 10 years was spent on the unix platform (AIX, Solaris and Linux). I ran Linux at home, Linux at work and I really enjoyed the work I did. The command line was very powerful. Unix has a very mature scripting environment that helped me develop some really good habits for scripting and automation. During those 10 years I shifted from a sysadmin role to more of a DBA role, managing Informix and Oracle databases on the unix platform. I really enjoyed the DBA role a lot.

Fast forward to 2007. I had a really good opportunity come up but it was mostly SQL Server. If had to put a number on it, it was 95% SQL Server and about 5% Oracle on Linux. Windows was a platform I had heard nightmare stories about and many of the SQL Server myth's were in full force at that time. SQL Server can't scale. SQL Server DBA's aren't real DBA's, they are just point-and-click drag-and-drop administrators. I had created my own judgement against SQL Server with little proof of any of it. Well, I decided to take this leap into the unknown and I soon found out how wrong I was about the Microsoft platform, specifically SQL Server.
