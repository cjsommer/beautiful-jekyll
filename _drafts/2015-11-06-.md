One of my favorite jobs as a DBA was definitely one of the most restrictive, financially speaking. I was part of a small IT team that supported a manufacturing operation. When I first took the job I remember just how much we didn't have. Our servers were 5+ years old and I swear I could hear the disk drives squeeking when I walked into the server room. We didn't have any sophisticated monitoring tools. Most people would have cringed and just limped the environment along, just as my predecessors did. But not me. I took this opportunity to be innovative and learn a heck of a lot about SQL Server. Seriously, as far as learning goes, I had hit the jackpot. 

One of the best environments to learn in is one where you don't have all the new shiny toys. 

There are still expectations of servers being online and available. There are still expectations of performance. There are still expectations of backup and recoverability.

Just because you don't have deep pockets to dig into doesn't exonerate you of being the best DBA you can be.

You don't have fancy monitoring tools?
