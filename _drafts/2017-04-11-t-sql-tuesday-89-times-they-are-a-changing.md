T-SQL Tuesday is a monthly blog party for the SQL Server community (or Microsoft Data Platform community. Although it’s called T-SQL Tuesday, it’s not limited to SQL Server database engine only). It is the brainchild of Adam Machanic (blog | twitter) and I’m honored to host this month’s edition. Each month a blog hosts the party and everybody who wants to contribute can write a post about the selected topic. You can find a list of all topics at <http://tsqltuesday.com/>.

This month's tsql2sday is being hosted by Koen Verbeeck ([blog](http://sqlkover.com/t-sql-tuesday-89-invitation-the-times-they-are-a-changing/)|[twitter](https://twitter.com/Ko_Ver)) and the topic is "The times they are a changing". Basically, how am you handling the ever changing landscape of the SQL DBA. And wow have they changed. 

It's a brave new world and the role of the DBA is definitely changing. The days of the old school point-n-click, drag-n-drop administrator are fleeting. Installing SQL Server. Checking backup. Performing helth checks. A Jedi-DBA craves not these things! 

DevOps DBA! DBA's in today's workforce are building tools and automating processes to help provide data as a service to their customers. Database administrators are becoming database engineers. As someone who embraced PowerShell and the automation mindset early on in my career, I personally love this transforamtion. Learning PowerShell (or some other scripting language) is paramount to success for the DevOps DBA.

Cloud DBA! Azure SQL Database, AWS, Google Cloud, etc. It's cheaper, right? As a good DBA my answer is "it depends". One of the misconceptions I saw was that because it said "SQL" in the name it came to the SQL Server group by default because "it's just SQL Server". Yeah I guess under the hood that is true, but the differences in managing SQL Server in the cloud is different than managing it in house. Glad I have had the opportunity to dabble in Azure land at my current position.

Linux SQL Server DBA! Penguins, penguins, everywhere! We're in the middle of a penguin invasion and it's all Microsoft's fault. SQL Server vNext [running on Linux](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-vnext-including-Linux). PowerShell open sourced and [running on Linux](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/powershell-is-open-sourced-and-is-available-on-linux/). .NET also [running on Linux](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#linuxredhat).
