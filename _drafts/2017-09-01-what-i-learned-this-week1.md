# Monday 2017-08-28
Today I learned that you can configure TempDB in RDS. I guess I hadn't even tried because you can't do anything to master, model or the msdb database. I was working on a presentation for tomorrow's AWS meetup and part of my presentation is about configuring SQL Server. I decided to try to add a second data file and was able to.
