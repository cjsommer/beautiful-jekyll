I was at SQL Saturday 723 in Rochester, NY last weekend. I was selected to deliver 2 sessions, and I planned to fill the rest of my schedule watching other session during the day. Overall this was another great SQL Saturday. But that's not why I'm here today...

A new session emerged in the lunch timeslot this year.

### The Women in Technology Panel Discussion.

This is the first time SQL Saturday Rochester has ever done a WIT panel. It was the only session during this timeslot and there was no abstract so I could see what it was all about beforehand. The lack on information left me questioning whether or not I should attend. Was this session just for women? 

So I decided to go and see for myself. I figured if there were no other men in attendance I could just pretend I was in the wrong room and leave. Somewhere along the way to room 2400 I met up with organizer, Andy Levy, and decided to ask him about the session. He assured me that men were definitely invited, and that he himself was headed to the session. This helped ease my fears a bit so I proceeded to room 2400 with Andy. I'm so glad I did. 

I just sat quietly and listened while some of the stories opened my eyes me to a not so great side of being a woman in technology. Some of it made me uncomfortable. Some of it made me sad. Some of it made me down right angry. I'd like to think that these things don't happen to women at my places of employment, but I'm not that naive. Maybe I just haven't been paying attention. Lets just say I came out of that session a little wiser and a little more aware. 

My favorite statement was addressed to all of the men in attendance. This may not be the exact words, but it went something like this:

"Men, please teach your daughters about the challenges they will face in the workplace, but make sure you also teach your sons."

What's the key message there? Education and awareness. Women already know the challenges they face - they're living it. Talking about it in an open forum with men will raise that awareness and hopefully together, we can help balance this ship.

So men, if you find yourself at a conference, and there is a Women in Technology Panel Discussion, yes you are invited. I highly encourage you to go and listen. Chances are you will hear something that makes you uncomfortable, sad, or mad too, and that's OK. That means you're actually listening! 

I don't have all the answers and I know its not something I can fix by myself, but I'm happy to partner with the women in technology to listen and support them in their quest for a better working landscape.
