# My Conference at a Glance
I decided to take full advantage of Summit v.20. Including both pre-con's, it was 5 days chock full of SQL Server learning and networking with other Microsoft data professionals (many of which who I am proud to call friends). I totally got my SQL Server geek on this week!

My first pre-con was Performance-Centric T-SQL by Itzik Ben-Gan.

My second pre-con was Fixing Query Performance Problems from Estimates, Statistics, Heuristics, and Cardinality by Kimberly Tripp.

Day 1 of the main conference. Key note was great.

Day 2
